# Comparison-based-Sorting-Algorithms

By executing and comparing Insertion sort, Merge sort, In place quick sort , and modified quick sort as different sorting techniques, with different input sizes. We have recorded the execution time for each of these sorting methods for different inputs.
Analyzed:
-Merge sort has the best stable performance when provided with any kind of input
-In-place quick sort was found to be the fastest algorithm with small input.
-Insertion sort algorithm was found to be best when data is more or less sorted.
